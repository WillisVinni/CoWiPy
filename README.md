# CoWiPy
Simple Python compiler!

Last version: 0.0.0

Our advantages
- Simple syntax!
- Lots of features!
- Compiling to EXE!
- Maximum speed!
- Using the C language right from the code!

## __Синтаксис кода__

code syntax is very similar to [Python](https://www.python.org/) syntax, but unlike it, there are absolutely no line separators in the language (Symbol ";")

## __Code example__

```py
print("Hello world")
if input()=="Hello":
    print("Hello!")
```

## __Start__
Enter the line data in the console.
```bat
CoWiPy file.q
rem or
CWP file.q
```
After that, **file.c** and **file.exe** will appear in the folder with the file.

## __Install__
Go to [Official CoWiPy website](url) then go to the _Downloads_ tab and select the file that suits your computer.


## __Variables__
To create variables, write the name of the variable, use an equal sign, and then specify the value of the variable.
```python
name="Some value"
print(name)
```
Output: ``Some value``

## __Functions__

Name | description
--- | ---
print | Text output.
input | Text input from the user.
eval | Mathematical calculations from a string.
if | Condition.
elif | If the previous condition is incorrect.
else | If all the conditions were not correct.
